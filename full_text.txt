Salesperson: Hello sir, welcome to YoCars Park. How can I assist you today?

Customer: I'm not sure yet.

Salesperson: No problem. Are you looking to shift to a new vehicle? May I have your contact number to keep you updated with our latest offers?

Customer: Sure, it's 99******90.

Salesperson: Great, thank you. Have you visited YoCars Park before?

Customer: Yes, I have.

Salesperson: Did you encounter any issues during your visit?

Customer: Yes, I had some concerns about the processing fees and other charges.

Salesperson: I understand. The processing fees are typically covered by the bank. Are you in need of some cash for the purchase?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Salesperson: Give me 5 minutes to arrange everything. I'll bring the car around for you to see.

Customer: Okay.

Salesperson: By the way, what's the main issue you're facing?

Customer: I'm from Delhi, and I'm worried about the paperwork and additional costs.

Salesperson: Don't worry. We handle all the paperwork, including RC transfer and any other necessary documents. The company covers these costs, so you won't have to pay extra. We ensure everything is included in the price.

Customer: That sounds good, but I'm still concerned about the price. It seems a bit expensive.

Salesperson: I understand your concern. Our prices are fixed, but they include all the features and services we offer. This means no hidden costs or additional charges later on. You're getting a comprehensive package.

Salesperson: If the papers are proper, we can't come here with other vehicles. If there's a problem with NOCL, we can't sell the vehicle. We've included all that in the price. There's no need to charge more. It's just that it's a bit late to get the RC. You need to buy the alternative documents. No one will create any problem for you. You've given us a delivery note. We've purchased it from YoCars. We're waiting for the RC card. If you show it to us, you won't be in any trouble.

Salesperson: If there's a chance, you can see this.

Customer: This?

Salesperson: Yes. Wait a minute. What did you say, sir? Did you reduce it?

Customer: No.

Salesperson: You won't get anything in YoCars. You can keep it as a backup vehicle. We don't sell it as a meter tamper.

Customer: Is that company selling it as a meter tamper? What's there for the customer? Is it a meter tamper that doesn't come to YoCars?

Salesperson: It's one lakh per year. In one year, there are vehicles that run 80,000 miles. In 10 years, there are vehicles that run 20,000 or 30,000 miles. But all the customers have kept it as a backup vehicle. It's an extra vehicle. It's not at home. That's why they keep it like that. In case you have any doubt, go and check with the mechanic.

Customer: There's no system. There's no music system. These are all after-market customer accessories. If there are power windows, they won't come in. They're customer accessories. You'll get four power windows.

Salesperson: Is that so?

Customer: Yes. It's an accessory. The AC is working. Every component is working in the car.

Salesperson: I'll take some time. It's getting hot.

Salesperson: Sir, please wait for 10 minutes.

Customer: I am driving.

Salesperson: Ok. Why are you standing there? Will you park there?

Salesperson: It is difficult to understand.

Salesperson: I have left you, ma'am.

Customer: Sir?

Salesperson: It has been leaked for the first time. It's too loose. There was greasing and all.

Customer: Is it too loose?

Salesperson: No, no. I mean, we brought an item. So, we have compared it. It differs from brand to brand. The steering is a bit tight in the Volkswagen, but it depends on the company. In the Tata, it is much smoother. I can turn it with one finger.

Customer: What is the vibration? Light vibration?

Customer: Clutch in the lower gear is vibrating. Do you want to try?

Salseperon: No, you stop here near the tree. We will check the engine and boot space.

Customer: Yes, let's do that.

Salesperson: Good afternoon, sir. Have you booked the vehicle yet?

Customer: Yes, I just booked it now.

Salesperson: Great! I see you booked it for 1 PM. Have you received any confirmation message?

Customer: No, I haven't received any message yet.

Salesperson: Sometimes there's a slight delay. I've set it to notify you once it goes live. You should also download our application and log in with the same number you used for booking. That way, you'll get real-time updates.

Customer: How much does it cost?

Salesperson: The exact price isn't listed in the application, but you'll receive a message once it's confirmed. If someone else has booked it, you'll know by this evening. I've scheduled a contact for you.

Customer: Can I get a loan for this vehicle?

Salesperson: Unfortunately, it's a bit challenging since the car is over 10 years old. The interest rates are usually higher for older vehicles. Do you have any existing loans?

Customer: I was considering YoCars finance. I'll need to check their terms.

Salesperson: That's a good option. I've logged your interest, and you'll get an update soon. I've scheduled it.

Customer: What other vehicles are available within this budget?

Salesperson: In the sedan category, we have a Swift 2 City. However, it's currently booked by someone else. If you set the "notify me" option, you'll be alerted once it's available. It should be updated by this evening.

Customer: How's the power of the car?

Salesperson: It has an 1800 cc engine. Once you take it to the garage for a tune-up, it will perform excellently. We've already done some preliminary tuning.

Customer: Do you need to check my eligibility for financing?

Salesperson: The application has already checked your eligibility.

Customer: Will this affect my credit score?

Salesperson: No, it won't. Have you completed any applications recently?

Customer: Yes, I have.

Salesperson: The eligibility check is done. Your eligibility varies depending on the model and vehicle. For cars less than 10 years old, we can contact the finance team for more details.

Customer: Can I take a test drive?

Salesperson: Yes, you can. However, the test drive from Rajajinagar was canceled. Would you like to reschedule?

Customer: Yes, let's do the test drive.

Salesperson: This car is a second-owner vehicle. Do you plan to use it daily? What's your expected mileage?

Customer: Around 10 km per liter.

Salesperson: This car has an 8.8-liter engine, so you might need to spend a bit more on fuel.

Customer: That's fine. Is the car non-tampered?

Salesperson: No, it has been tampered with, but it has undergone company service.

Customer: How can I proceed with this vehicle?

Salesperson: The vehicle is already booked. If it goes live, you can book it immediately. The booking amount ranges from 10k to 25k.

Customer: No one informed me about this. Next time, please notify me when it goes live.

Salesperson: Certainly, sir. Navin will contact you once it's live.

Customer: What is FC?

Salesperson: FC stands for Fitness Certificate. For petrol cars, it's valid for 15 years. Navin will provide more details.

Customer: Is this car roadworthy?

Salesperson: Yes, but it has been modified. The bonnet has been altered.

Customer: Okay.

Salesperson: Once you receive the original RC card, you can transfer ownership. Currently, the RC card hasn't been generated. It usually takes about 90 days for the transfer process.

Customer: 90 days?

Salesperson: Yes, sir. It might take up to 50 days in some cases. Have you filed your ITR?

Customer: Yes, I have.

Salesperson: Great. Make sure to update your finishing details.

Customer: Okay, will do.

Salesperson: If the vehicle goes live, you can book it immediately. If it's not live, it might be booked for up to 3 days. If the current holder cancels, you'll be notified right away. You can book it online for Rs. 10,000. Once the payment is made, our finance team will contact you for further details. If the loan isn't approved, you can decide how to proceed.

Customer: Understood. Thank you for the information.

Salesperson: You're welcome, sir. Have a great day!
Salesperson: The price is 10.72 lakhs for the 2018 model with 41,000 km driven. It's a single owner, automatic car. The original price was 9.94 lakhs, but they mentioned a 1 lakh discount on the app.

Customer: What about the features?

Salesperson: It has 2 ventilators installed and an AC vent. Regarding the charging port, you can install one, but there is no wireless charger available. You would have to plug it in. If you want to install a wireless charger, it would be helpful if it's from the OEM. If it's from the outer market, it will come with a 3-month warranty.

Customer: How much would that cost approximately?

Salesperson: Approximately, it will be around 10,000 because you have to change the full setup.

Customer: What about the shift lock release?

Salesperson: The shift lock release is for safety in case of a peak or hill support.

Customer: My brother has the same car.

Salesperson: That's great! After taking a car deal, you will be getting a warranty for 1 year and a comprehensive warranty for 3 months. The 1 year or 12,000 km warranty covers the engine and gearbox.

Customer: Is there an option for an extended warranty?

Salesperson: There is no option for an extended warranty because we are already offering a 10% discount. The extended warranty depends on the car model.

Customer: How does that work?

Salesperson: For some models, it could be around 1 lakh for 2 years or 24,000 km, plus an additional 12 months for comprehensive electrical warranty.

Customer: So, I would get an additional 12 months or 12,000 km?

Salesperson: Yes, that's correct.

Customer: What about the test drive?

Salesperson: If you want to test drive, you can do it.

Customer: I booked a test drive for the RDA3 on Thursday, but that's from Belandur.

Salesperson: How much would it cost to deregister?

Customer: Because that car is registered in Haryana, will I need to pay anything extra?

Salesperson: No, the same price includes everything. You will need to pay for the RC transfer, but that will be included in the price.

Customer: So, I will be paying new road tax for Karnataka registration?

Salesperson: Yes, you will be paying the road tax, and then you will get it registered in Karnataka.

Customer: How long will that take?

Salesperson: It will take about 150 days for the Karnataka registration.

Customer: So, I can start driving with the Haryana number in the meantime?

Salesperson: Yes, the RC transfer will be in process, and it will take about 50 days to get the new number.

Customer: So, the price listed in the application is the final price?

Salesperson: Yes, that includes everything: registration for the Karnataka number, RC transfer, emission pass tax, and more.

Customer: What about the service before delivery?

Salesperson: The price includes one service before delivery, and the car is already serviced.

Customer: Why is the vehicle not clean?

Salesperson: It's in an open area, but we will clean it before delivery.

Customer: I also noticed some scratches on the rear bumper. 

Salesperson: I apologize for that. We will ensure that all scratches are taken care of before delivery. 

Customer: Where do you stay?

Salesperson: I stay in Whitefield.

Customer: I wanted my wife to do a test drive.

Salesperson: I can arrange a test drive for you.

Customer: I paid 10,000 already for this car.

Salesperson: I will arrange a test drive for you in Whitefield.

Customer: I am okay to take this car or the RDA3.

Salesperson: That's good to hear.

Customer: Have you already blocked the test drive?

Salesperson: I haven't blocked it yet, but if you can block it, it's well and good in case someone else gets it.

Customer: I saw that, that's why I booked the 10,000.

Salesperson: You can do a test drive for both cars, and then you can make your decision.

Customer: Sir, can I have a contact number?

Salesperson: Sure, it's 94******310.

Salesperson: Thank you for your payment of 10,000. How many days will you hold this car?

Customer: 3 days.

Salesperson: Exactly, that's what is mentioned. We will hold it. You can block that car as well, so you can take a test drive on that day. You can test drive both cars and then make your decision. If you end up buying another car, that amount will be transferred here, or it will be transferred to the other car if you haven't tried it. The full amount is refundable.

Customer: Okay, cool. Can you do this for me on Thursday? Can you bring this car for a test drive? I can give you my location.

Salesperson: Sure, I can arrange that.

Customer: I am happy to pay for even the test drive.

Salesperson: That's what I told the customer. Someone called me and mentioned that we can only do a test drive for 25 kilometers.

Customer: I asked for a home test drive because my wife can also be a part of it. I came from work, actually.

Salesperson: No worries. How far is it from here to your home?

Customer: Should be 32 kilometers.

Salesperson: I will speak to my manager and arrange for a test drive. You don't need to pay anything extra. Just don't cancel the booking.

Customer: I want my family to be there.

Salesperson: If we take the other direction, it could be 37 kilometers, or 34 kilometers if it's the other route. Anything around will be below 40 kilometers.

Customer: I will show you my number. You can just WhatsApp me the location.

Salesperson: Sure, I will let you know what time it requires. Something like 6 to 7 would work.

Customer: If that is the case, what time works for Thursday for you?

Salesperson: Morning around 10 would be good. I will arrange it for you.

Customer: 10 to 11 works for me.

Salesperson: Perfect. I will manage it for 11 o'clock on Thursday morning.

Customer: That's my number. I already received a call for a loan, actually. I told them I will wait for one or two days to do the test drive.

Salesperson: No worries. Just don't cancel the booking, as I won't be able to arrange it later if you do.

Customer: Got it.

Salesperson: I will WhatsApp you the location now.

Customer: I will also book the RD.

Salesperson: Go ahead. You can check in the app.

Customer: So many people have been interested.

Salesperson: This is the biggest thing; we have opened recently, and all premium cars were parked here earlier.

Customer: Okay, I texted you the location.

Salesperson: I will arrange it for you. I will give you the confirmation by tomorrow.

Customer: Perfect. Can you also do me a favor? Can you check the driver and the air light? Don't touch anything; it's completely brand new.

Salesperson: I will check those things and share the inspection report as well.

Customer: Thank you. I am going to leave it at that. I will not cancel.

Salesperson: Tomorrow evening, I will arrange this for you.

Customer: Thank you so much. If you receive any test drive feedback, please let me know.

Salesperson: Thank you so much, sir. I will arrange a call for you. Good night.

Customer: Bye.

Salesperson: There is no body work. Everyone is mentioned here. The door is repainted and the apple is mentioned. The door is repainted. The dent and scratches are not there. We are asking for the comparison. That's why we are asking for the price.

**Salesperson:** Good afternoon, sir! How can I assist you today?

**Customer:** I'm here to check out the car you mentioned over the phone.

**Salesperson:** Absolutely, sir. The Swift 2019 model, right? Is it the ZXI variant you're interested in?

**Customer:** Yes, that's correct.

**Salesperson:** Great! Just to clarify, it's not the WB registeration, it's the KN registeration. You've seen it already, correct?

**Customer:** Yes, I have. But I noticed something about the paint job.

**Salesperson:** Ah, I see. The car number is 7064. It has been repainted, but rest assured, it hasn't been in any accidents. There are some scratches and dents, but nothing major. This model is automatic, not manual.

**Customer:** I see. What about the other details?

**Salesperson:** This is the 693, 2019 model VXI. It's a single-owner vehicle, Rathombath model, and has been used for 12 years. All modifications, including the roof color and paint, are aftermarket.

**Customer:** And the key? Can I take a look inside?

**Salesperson:** Of course, sir. You just need to open it with the key. By the way, this car has already been booked. But let me show you another option. Here we have a 2022 model ZXI, ZXI Plus, priced at 8 lakhs.

**Customer:** 2022 model? What's the mileage and condition?

**Salesperson:** Yes, sir. It's a 2022 model with only 16,000 kms on it. It's a single-owner, complete top-end model, ZXI Plus, and the price has dropped to 8 lakhs.

**Customer:** What about other options?

**Salesperson:** We also have a 21 model, front VX, R27, 693. It has been repainted and all modifications are aftermarket. You can keep looking around, and I'll be back in 10 minutes after lunch.

**Customer:** Alright, I'll take a look. Can I get your mobile number?

**Salesperson:** Sure, sir. It's 575***666. Please keep watching, and take a photo of the number plate if you need. Not all vehicles have been opened yet.

**Customer:** Thanks. What about this grey VXI from the front? It's a 21 model, right?

**Salesperson:** Yes, sir. That's correct. Please have a seat in the front. By the way, where's your mobile number? Who took your vehicle?

**Customer:** My number is 97***906. How much is this one?

**Salesperson:** It's priced at 50. I've given you all the information about the car. You can stand here while I walk you through the details.

**Customer:** Do you think the belts are loose?

**Salesperson:** No, no, sir. That's quite common. The company's code is 21. You'll get around 18 km/l on the highway, 17-18 in Bangalore.

**Customer:** Alright. Anything else I should know?

**Salesperson:** Just a tip, sir. Use only your right leg while driving; using the left leg can confuse the system. This car is priced at 6,69,300 and it comes with a 1-year warranty for the engine and gearbox. It's already been serviced at 12,000 kms, and the next service is due at 22,000 kms.

**Customer:** Sounds good. But why is the booking amount 10,000?

**Salesperson:** It's because of the loan process, sir. Do you have my number? Please call me if you decide to book.

**Customer:** Alright, I'll think about it. Thank you.

**Salesperson:** Thank you, sir. Have a great day!

Customer: WB registration?

Salesperson: Yes, but we can include Karnataka registration at the same price. However, for diesel vehicles, you might not find many options. You could consider petrol vehicles like the I-10 or Eon.

Customer: The I-10 is too small.

Salesperson: In that case, you might want to look at the Alto. With a budget of 3.5 lakhs, you won't find a Venue or I-20.

Customer: What?

Salesperson: Yes, the Venue starts from 9 lakhs. The I-20 starts from 5 lakhs minimum. You can consider it.

Customer: How much is the vehicle price?

Salesperson: We have diesel options available. What do you think about this vehicle?

Customer: It looks okay, but what about the warranty?

Salesperson: The warranty is for one year. If not, the engine and gearbox are covered for 100,000 Km.

Customer: What about the Swift diesel?

Salesperson: It's available for 100,000 Km. It's a 2011 model with 1,22,000 Km on it.

Customer: And the second one?

Salesperson: That one has 3,21,000 Km on it.

Customer: What about the Tiago?

Salesperson: The Tiago has 16,000 Km on it. It's white, a Tata Tiago, with 86,000 Km. It's a diesel and comes at a fixed price with no negotiation.

Customer: Where are you from?

Salesperson: I'm from Mangalore. This is a 2010 model, diesel, priced at Rs. 340,000. The petrol version costs Rs. 662,000. The starting model is Rs. 662,000. How much does a new one cost?

Customer: Around Rs. 12,000.

Salesperson: The new one costs Rs. 18,000. You can take a test drive of the vehicle you like.

Customer: Can I see the car?

Salesperson: Absolutely. Here it is.

Customer: Hmm, the paint job seems a bit off, and there are some scratches. Also, the interior isn't very clean.

Salesperson: I apologize for that. We can have the paint job touched up and the interior thoroughly cleaned before delivery. Would that be acceptable?

Customer: That sounds better. I'll think about it.

Salesperson: Sure, take your time. If you decide to book today, just let us know. We can finalize everything for you.

Customer: Alright, I'll get back to you soon.
```

Salesperson: Good afternoon, sir. How can I assist you today?
Customer: Good afternoon. I'm looking for a car within a budget of Rs. 600,000. My primary concerns are safety and proper maintenance. I don't have any specific preference for the vehicle size or type.
Salesperson: Understood, sir. We have a variety of options that might suit your needs. Are you looking for an automatic or manual transmission?
Customer: I don't have a preference for that either. Just show me what fits my budget and requirements.
Salesperson: Certainly, sir. We ensure that all our vehicles undergo a thorough 200-point inspection to guarantee they are non-accidental, non-meter tampered, and have a complete service history. This way, you can be assured of the vehicle's condition.
Customer: That's good to know. What kind of warranty do you offer after purchase?
Salesperson: Once you purchase a vehicle, you will have a one-year or 15,000 kilometers warranty on the engine and gearbox. Additionally, for three months or 5,000 kilometers, we cover the AC, electrical, and fuel systems. We also offer a five-day money-back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the vehicle.
Customer: That sounds reassuring. So, what options do you have in my budget?
Salesperson: Let me show you a few options. We have both budget and assured categories. The budget vehicles might have higher mileage and more owners, while the assured ones are well-maintained and in showroom condition. 
Customer: I see. Can you show me a sedan? I prefer something at least the size of a Fabia.
Salesperson: Absolutely, sir. Here is a 2015 Honda City. It's a well-maintained sedan with 1,20,000 kilometers on it. 
Customer: How much is it?
Salesperson: This one is priced at Rs. 6,97,000. However, I must mention that it has a few minor scratches and the paint job isn't perfect. But mechanically, it's in excellent condition.
Customer: Hmm, the scratches and paint job are a bit concerning. Do you have anything else?
Salesperson: We also have a 2014 Maruti Suzuki Ciaz. It's slightly older but has fewer kilometers on it. The paint and exterior are in better condition compared to the Honda City.
Customer: What about the engine and overall maintenance?
Salesperson: Both vehicles have been thoroughly inspected and are in good mechanical condition. The Ciaz has a quieter engine and a cleaner interior.
Customer: That's good to hear. What about the resale value after three years?
Salesperson: For assured vehicles, we offer a buy-back guarantee. For example, if you choose the Honda City, after one year, we will buy it back for Rs. 5,00,000, after two years for Rs. 4,32,000, and after three years for Rs. 4,00,000. This is subject to the vehicle not exceeding 10,000 kilometers per year and being serviced at authorized centers.
Customer: That sounds fair. Can I take a test drive?
Salesperson: Of course, sir. You can either come to our showroom or book a home test drive. The home test drive slots are available within one or two days.
Customer: I live about five kilometers from here. Can we arrange a home test drive?
Salesperson: Certainly, sir. I will book a slot for you. You will receive a confirmation shortly.
Customer: Thank you. I appreciate your help.
Salesperson: My pleasure, sir. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to contact us. Have a great day!
Customer: Thank you. Goodbye.
Salesperson: Goodbye, sir.
Salesperson: We have a few options in terms of colors, sir. What color are you interested in? So far we've got only blue and white.  
Customer: Okay, white is okay. No special preference, and what about the budget? How much can you offer for that? No details mentioned.  
Salesperson: Yes, let me confirm. The starting price is around Rs. 10,50,000. That’s for the 2021 model, diesel SUV.  
Customer: The car without any label? You remove the labels for the sold ones, or what?  
Salesperson: Correct, sir. Sold cars don’t usually have labels on them.  
Customer: Right, so my requirement is...  
Salesperson: Sure, sir. What are you looking for?  
Customer: I have a budget of about Rs. 800,000, and I'm really looking for something spacious and safe, safety first. Maybe a compact SUV, yes, compact SUV. And maybe like a Mahindra XUV or something similar.  
Salesperson: I understand, sir. We can certainly find a suitable vehicle for that. What about fuel type?  
Customer: No petrol, please. Diesel only.  
Salesperson: Manual or automatic transmission preferences, sir?  
Customer: I don’t, I don’t mind, whatever is best for my budget.  
Salesperson: Okay, understood, sir. We have both options in our inventory. Regarding safety, our vehicles are well maintained and undergo a thorough checkup.  
Customer: How do you ensure they are safe?  
Salesperson: We conduct a comprehensive 200-point inspection before purchasing any vehicle. So, if you like it, it's definitely safe to purchase.  
Customer: But how can I trust that it's always maintained well? There might be hidden problems.  
Salesperson: No, sir, we get detailed service history of each vehicle. Plus, non-accidental, no meter tampering, and all that.  
Customer: So what support do I get after I buy? I mean, like warranty?  
Salesperson: Yes, of course. We offer a warranty on the engine and gearbox for one year or 15,000 kilometers. And a warranty on AC and electricals for three months or 5,000 kilometers.  
Customer: Wait, so the warranty is just three months for that?  
Salesperson: Correct, just three months, yes.  
Customer: So if something goes wrong after three months?  
Salesperson: We also have a five-day money-back guarantee. If you aren’t satisfied, you can return the car.  
Customer: Within five days, like? But what about the registration?  
Salesperson: The registration process only starts after five days, yes.  
Customer: So, till then? What’s the process for ownership during that time?  
Salesperson: You won't be the registered owner until we start the process.  
Customer: Will I get a confirmation before that?  
Salesperson: Yes, a confirmation will be sent once the process begins.  
Customer: Great. So can you now, um, check if we have SUVs that fit my requirements?  
Salesperson: Absolutely, let me find options in SUVs within that range.  
Customer: I want to avoid small ones, you know? Like, the tiny models.  
Salesperson: Sure, no hatchbacks then. So you prefer compact SUVs?  
Customer: Yes, I don’t like hatchbacks at all. Something spacious. Like, what about, maybe, a Creta?  
Salesperson: We actually have Creta available, let me check... Yes, it’s a 2019 model with good history.  
Customer: How much does the Creta cost?  
Salesperson: It’s priced around Rs. 9,50,000. Just over your budget a bit.  
Customer: If I need to go lower, what do you suggest?  
Salesperson: We can look at vehicles from 2017. Mileage would be higher, but still in decent condition.  
Customer: Okay, okay, if I wanted to consider really low mileage, would that be within budget?  
Salesperson: Yes, slightly older models could potentially fit within your budget, sir.  
Customer: Like, uh, if the mileage is higher, does that affect the resale value later on?  
Salesperson: Definitely, mileage can impact the resale value.  
Customer: Okay, I see. So what's the driveable life of these models?  
Salesperson: You can expect around 2 lakh kilometers if maintained well.  
Customer: Okay. What about test drives? Can I take one?  
Salesperson: You have to, please, come into the showroom for a test drive, or we can organize a home test drive for you.  
Customer: Okay, I may want a home test drive, but when can I schedule that?  
Salesperson: Availability varies, may take a couple of days. But we can arrange soon.  
Customer: Okay then. Thanks for your help!  
Salesperson: My pleasure, sir
